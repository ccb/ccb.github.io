		<h2> Idea </h2>

			Hands free interfaces feel like a solution searching for a problem. While novel, its not clear they are better than a mouse or touch interface for most tasks. The technology is in need of a killer application. In the medical field doctors and nurses working in surgery have to keep their hands sterile but often still want to be able to consult medical imagery. My colleauges and I tried to find a way they could interact with medical images but without touching any interfaces. 
		</p>
		
		<h2> Initial Work </h2>
		<p>
			<img class='medium-thumbnail left-with-padding' src='mrk-towards.gif'></img>
			In our initial attempt we tried to solve two problems together; visualizing using an iPad moving through space and visualizing without hands. We also incorporated a digital tabletop which acted as a wayfinder, allowing users to locate the dataset relative to the body. As the user moved the iPad (or their hand) over the tabletop they were located and tracked using a Microsoft Kinect. Knowing the location relative to the table we could then compute the appropriate slice and display it. Using the iPad for visualization create an interesting experience, moving through the data above the tabletop while using a hand allowed for the desirable hands-free interaction.

		<h2> Later Work </h2>
		<p id="third">
			While our initial prototype allowed a user to work with the imaging data in a novel way, it could not deal with real medical imaging data. This data tends to be large and  is stored in a complex data format. Rather than creating a viewer from scratch, I chose to add a hands-free interface to an existing imager. For this system I chose to use a Leap Motion which can detect objects at a closer range to the sensor. In the example a user moves their hand backward and forward to move through a set of slices while moving up and down zooms in on one specific slice.

		<h2> Continuing</h2>
		<p>
			This work is still in its early stages and could be assisted by more interaction with medical staff about their specific needs. Further advances in sensing technology can only improve the usability of these systems.
